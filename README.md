# wANMS
This repository hosts the implementation of Accelerated Adaptive Nelder–Mead Simplex Method using Weighted Centroids (wANMS). Furthermore the demos of classical Nelder-Mead Simplex optimization algorithm and the wANMS on 2-dimensional Rastrigin's function have been accessed under the subfolder https://github.com/kgunel/wANMS/demos.
